> # **API Routes in NextJs**

* API routing mechanism is similar to page based routing mechanism
* APIs are associated with a route based on their file name
* Every API route exports a default function typically named as handler function
* The handler function receives the request and response as parameters
* Cater to different request types like GET, POST and DELETE using req.method
* Dynamic API Routes
* Catch all API Routes
* We should not call our own API routes for pre-rendering content
